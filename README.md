pic_preview
===========

A simple demo of thumbnail previews

This is a ruby sinatra app that
* creates a form that allows multiple file uploads
* uses a simple JavaScript routine and the FileReader API to create thumbnails
* echos the form when it is submitted to show the params hash
* does *not* store any uploaded files.
